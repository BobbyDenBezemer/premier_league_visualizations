## Minimum viable product
- An interactive bar chart which displays the premier league team rankings. 
Through a drop down menu, the user can select a given year to be displayed in the bar chart. 
The bar chart will then update itself.
- An interactive map which shows the distribution of the premier league teams across the UK over the entire period
from 1992-2014. The map should transition from one year to another in a an automatic fashion. Once the transition is over
the user should be able to select a given year through a drop down menu. 

## Extras
- Interactive line charts which shows the premier league wage expenses of premier league teams. 
The user can select through a checkerbox which teams they want to display, including the average
- A worldmap which is interactive in the same sense as is the map under minimum viable product.
This map displays the distribution of nationalities that play in the premier league during a given year.
Once the transition is over, the user should be able to select a given year through a drop down menu.

## A list of javascript functions
- Three seperate scripts, 1 for drawing the interactive bar chart and 1 for drawing an interactive map.
- Both scripts contain data loading functions, draw functions and code that attaches event handlers to the dropdown menus
- A script with helper functions that are easy to use wrappers to do things that would otherwise require you to write many ugly
for loops within your other scripts. The scripts will for instance contain an isUnique() function

## Data sources
- The premier league rankings are scraped from statto.com
- The data on UK club stadium locations and stadium capacities are webscraped from doogal.co.uk
- The UK.json file for the interactive map with administrative regions is acquired from martinjc's github
